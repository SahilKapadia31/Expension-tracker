# Expense Tracker App

A full-stack expense tracker application built using **React** (Frontend) and **Node.js + Express** (Backend). This app allows users to track their expenses, visualize their spending habits through charts, and manage them with CRUD operations. The application also supports secure authentication with JWT tokens and allows role-based access for regular users and admin users.

## Features

### Frontend
- **Expense Form**: Add expenses with validation (amount must be a number, date must be valid, etc.), with auto-suggestions for categories.
- **Expense List**: View and filter expenses by amount, date, or category. Implement inline editing for expense entries.
- **Charts**: View monthly expense comparisons and category breakdowns in visual charts.
- **State Management**: Uses React Context API for global state management.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive user interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Backend
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - CRUD operations for expenses (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Advanced filtering and sorting for expense records by category, date range, and payment method.
  - CSV upload for batch importing expenses.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: 
  - JWT-based authentication for secure user login.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate between regular users and admin users.
- **Data Handling**: 
  - MongoDB aggregation framework for generating expense statistics.
  - Error handling and optimization (e.g., caching frequently accessed data).

### Full Stack Integration
- Integrated frontend with backend for seamless CRUD operations.
- Real-time data updates with chart integrations.
- Deployment-ready with Vercel for frontend and Heroku/Render for backend.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Axios, CSS-in-JS (Styled Components), Chart.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT, bcrypt
- **Development Tools**: Axios, Jest (testing), Vercel (deployment), Heroku (backend deployment)
- **State Management**: React Context API

## Requirements

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js and npm installed.
2. MongoDB database set up (locally or on cloud like MongoDB Atlas).
3. A tool to test APIs (e.g., Postman or Swagger).

### Backend
- Node.js v14+ (or compatible)
- MongoDB database

### Frontend
- React v17+ (or compatible)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/expense-tracker.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd expense-tracker
   ```
3. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
4. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
   - The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Run the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
   - The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Login/Register** to access the app, and start tracking your expenses.

## API Documentation

For backend API documentation, refer to [API Docs](swagger-url) or use Postman for exploring the API routes.

### Example API Routes:

- `GET /api/expenses` - Retrieve all expenses with filters.
- `GET /api/expenses/:id` - Get an expense by ID.
- `PATCH /api/expenses/:id` - Update an expense by ID.
- `DELETE /api/expenses/:id` - Delete an expense by ID.

## Testing

To run tests for the backend and frontend:

1. **Backend testing**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm test
   ```

2. **Frontend testing**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm test
   ```
